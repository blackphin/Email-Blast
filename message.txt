I just wanted to write to you personally because I have heard good things about your campus and school and I am interested. I am a Grade 10 Student from New Delhi, India, and I wanted to see if you had any t-shirts or paraphernalia available so I could represent your school! I am not from a very rich family but I aspire to study at a great college. I am interested in majoring in Physics and I am very interested in your school; I feel like I would shine there. I want to study abroad as it will allow me to use my full potential and would give me insane research opportunities further in my life. I want to become an Experimental Physicist. If you have any t-shirts L size, pennants, or anything you want to send. I would appreciate it greatly! I would love to have your college's T-shirts as they will allow me to tell people in India about study abroad opportunities.
